![SPARTACUS: An open dataset of normal shoulder girdle kinematics](https://github.com/Ipuch/spartacus-shoulder-kinematic-dataset/blob/main/docs/logo.png?raw=true)

**The primary objective of this repository is to gather existing studies reporting gold-standard measurements of sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, scapulothoracic, and glenohumeral joint kinematics in a common dataset through a rigorous methodology**. Combining datasets opens new avenues for more complete overviews of the shoulder girdle kinematics. First, this allows us to further document the 24 degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) of the shoulder girdle (4 joints x 6 DoFs per joint) during various standardised arm motions. Second, this should minimise experimental bias as original datasets are sourced from *ex vivo* or *in vivo* experiments with different measuring techniques and kinematic processing. Third, this may facilitate study comparisons by providing a unified convention for kinematics re-processing.

The secondary objective of this repository is to propose a toolbox to complete the present dataset with new measurements, ensuring the homogeneity of data. For that, a set of tools are and will be added to this repository to allow data related to most common approaches to be transformed into the standards of the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB)<sup>[1]</sup>.
